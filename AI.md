### What Worked
I gave the AI the UI.java file to edit the error messages to make Darwin's character more unique

### What didn't
Some of the error messages they suggested changing didnt make my chatbot Darwin seem like a task tracking
manager, so i had to manually edit the error messages to make it still meaningful

### Time Saved
